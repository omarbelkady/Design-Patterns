# Design Patterns in Java
* Once we create a class, it is known as a blueprint. We create an instance of a class which are known as objects. *
* They are composed of fields which are what an object can comprehend and these are the instance variables *
* The functionality of a class are what we call methods. These are all the functions that an object can do. *
